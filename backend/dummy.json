It is critical to identify and classify skin cancer early to assist patients in taking the right course of action. Additionally, melanoma, one of the main skin cancer illnesses, is curable when detected and treated at an early stage. More than 75% of fatalities worldwide are related to skin cancer. A novel Artificial Golden Eagle-based Random Forest (AGEbRF) is created in this study to predict skin cancer cells at an early stage. Dermoscopic images are used in this instance as the dataset for the system's training. Additionally, the dermoscopic image information is processed using the established AGEbRF function to identify and segment the skin cancer-affected area. Additionally, this approach is simulated using a Python program, and the current research's parameters are assessed against those of earlier studies. The results demonstrate that, compared to other models, the new research model produces better accuracy for predicting skin cancer by segmentation.

Therefore, the suggested approach finds the main hole in undersea systems and fills it using robotic automation. In the predicted model, an analytical framework is created to operate the robot within predetermined areas while maximizing communication ranges. Additionally, a clustering algorithm with a fuzzy membership function is implemented, allowing the robots to advance in accordance with predefined clusters and arrive at their starting place within a predetermined amount of time. A cluster node is connected in each clustered region and provides the central control center with the necessary data. The weights are evenly distributed, and the designed robotic system is installed to prevent an uncontrolled operational state. Five different scenarios are used to test and validate the created model, and in each case, the proposed method is found to be superior to the current methodology in terms of range, energy, density, time periods, and total metrics of operation.

These digital biomarkers are created mainly through passive data collection from various sensors. The critical issues with this method are time and sensitivity. We reviewed the newest wireless communication trends employed in hospitals using wearable technology and privacy and Block chain to solve this problem. Based on sensors, this wireless technology controls the data gathered from numerous locations. In this study, the wearable sensor contains data from the various departments of the system. The gradient boosting method and the hybrid microwave transmission method have been proposed to find the location and convince people. The patient health decision has been submitted to hybrid microwave transmission using gradient boosting. This will help to trace the mobile phones using the calls from the threatening person, and the data is gathered from the database while tracing. From this concern, the data analysis process is based on decision-making. They adapted the data encountered by the detailed data in the statistical modeling of the system to produce exploratory data analysis for satisfying the data from the database.

                "abstract": "The specialty of desktop-as-a-service cloud computing is that user can access their desktop and can execute applications in virtual desktops on remote servers. Resource management and resource utilization are most significant in the area of desktop-as-a-service, cloud computing; however, handling a large amount of clients in the most efficient manner poses important challenges. Especially deciding how many clients to handle on one server, and where to execute the user applications at each time is important. This is because we have to ensure maximum resource utilization along with user data confidentiality, customer satisfaction, scalability, minimum Service level agreement (SLA) violation etc. Assigning too many users to one server leads to customer dissatisfaction, while assigning too little leads to higher investments costs. So we have taken into consideration these two situations also. We study different aspects to optimize the resource usage and customer satisfaction. Here in this paper We proposed Intelligent Resource Allocation (IRA) Technique which assures the above mentioned parameters like minimum SLA violation. For this, priorities are assigned to user requests based on their SLA Factors in order to maintain their confidentiality. The results of the paper indicate that by applying IRA Technique to the already existing overbooking mechanism will improve the performance of the system with significant reduction in SLA violation."

Cross-lingual transfer is an attractive solution to this problem,because low-resource languages can potentially benefit from higher-resourcelanguages either through transfer learning, or being jointly trained in thesame multilingual model. The problem of cross-lingual transfer has been wellstudied in ASR, however, recent advances in Self Supervised Learning areopening up avenues for unlabeled speech data to be used in multilingual ASRmodels, which can pave the way for improved performance on low-resourcelanguages. In this paper, we survey the state of the art in multilingual ASRmodels that are built with cross-lingual transfer in mind. We present bestpractices for building multilingual models from research across diverselanguages and techniques, discuss open questions and provide recommendationsfor future work."

Despitetheir impressive capabilities, LLMs often exhibit significant performancedisparities across different languages and cultural contexts, as demonstratedby various text-only benchmarks. However, current research lacks suchbenchmarks for multimodal visio-linguistic settings. This work fills this gapby introducing M5, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LMMson diverse vision-language tasks within a multilingual and multiculturalcontext. M5 includes eight datasets covering five tasks and $41$ languages,with a focus on underrepresented languages and culturally diverse images.Furthermore, we introduce two novel datasets, M5-VGR and M5-VLOD, including anew Visio-Linguistic Outlier Detection task, in which all evaluated open-sourcemodels fail to significantly surpass the random baseline. Through extensiveevaluation and analyses, we highlight substantial task-agnostic performancedisparities between high- and low-resource languages. Moreover, we show thatlarger models do not necessarily outperform smaller ones in a multilingualsetting."

We argue that this makes the existing practices inmultilingual evaluation unreliable and does not provide a full picture of theperformance of MMLMs across the linguistic landscape. We propose that therecent work done in Performance Prediction for NLP tasks can serve as apotential solution in fixing benchmarking in Multilingual NLP by utilizingfeatures related to data and language typology to estimate the performance ofan MMLM on different languages. We compare performance prediction withtranslating test data with a case study on four different multilingualdatasets, and observe that these methods can provide reliable estimates of theperformance that are often on-par with the translation based approaches,without the need for any additional translation as well as evaluation costs."

We first investigate the calibration of MMLMs in the zero-shotsetting and observe a clear case of miscalibration in low-resource languages orthose which are typologically diverse from English. Next, we empirically showthat calibration methods like temperature scaling and label smoothing doreasonably well towards improving calibration in the zero-shot scenario. Wealso find that few-shot examples in the language can further help reduce thecalibration errors, often substantially. Overall, our work contributes towardsbuilding more reliable multilingual models by highlighting the issue of theirmiscalibration, understanding what language and model specific factorsinfluence it, and pointing out the strategies to improve the same."

Most research on evaluating and mitigating fairness harms has beenconcentrated on English, while multilingual models and non-English languageshave received comparatively little attention. This paper presents a survey offairness in multilingual and non-English contexts, highlighting theshortcomings of current research and the difficulties faced by methods designedfor English. We contend that the multitude of diverse cultures and languagesacross the world makes it infeasible to achieve comprehensive coverage in termsof constructing fairness datasets. Thus, the measurement and mitigation ofbiases must evolve beyond the current dataset-driven practices that arenarrowly focused on specific dimensions and types of biases and, therefore,impossible to scale across languages and cultures."

One such technique, known as masked predictive coding (MPC),has been employed by some of the most high-performing models. In this study, weinvestigate the impact of MPC loss on the type of information learnt at variouslayers in the HuBERT model, using nine probing tasks. Our findings indicatethat the amount of content information learned at various layers of the HuBERTmodel has a positive correlation to the MPC loss. Additionally, it is alsoobserved that any speaker-related information learned at intermediate layers ofthe model, is an indirect consequence of the learning process, and thereforecannot be controlled using the MPC loss. These findings may serve asinspiration for further research in the speech community, specifically in thedevelopment of new pre-training tasks or the exploration of new pre-trainingcriterion's that directly preserves both speaker and content information atvarious layers of a learnt model."

In this work, we investigate some of thechallenges with evaluating and mitigating biases in multilingual settings whichstem from a lack of existing benchmarks and resources for bias evaluationbeyond English especially for non-western context. In this paper, we firstcreate a benchmark for evaluating gender biases in pre-trained masked languagemodels by extending DisCo to different Indian languages using humanannotations. We extend various debiasing methods to work beyond English andevaluate their effectiveness for SOTA massively multilingual models on ourproposed metric. Overall, our work highlights the challenges that arise whilestudying social biases in multilingual settings and provides resources as wellas mitigation techniques to take a step toward scaling to more languages."

Our evaluation encompasses all supported inference modes of therecent VLMs, including image-to-text, text-to-text, text-to-image, andimage-to-image. Additionally, we propose an automated pipeline to generatehigh-quality synthetic datasets that intentionally conceal gender, race, andage information across different professional domains, both in generated textand images. The dataset includes action-based descriptions of each professionand serves as a benchmark for evaluating societal biases in vision-languagemodels (VLMs). In our comparative analysis of widely used VLMs, we haveidentified that varying input-output modalities lead to discernible differencesin bias magnitudes and directions. Additionally, we find that VLM modelsexhibit distinct biases across different bias attributes we investigated. Wehope our work will help guide future progress in improving VLMs to learnsocially unbiased representations. We will release our data and code."

In this paper, we propose (i) a Swapmethod to address pre-training and inference mismatch observed in HuBERT and(ii) incorporates Multicluster masked prediction loss for more effectiveutilization of the models capacity. The resulting method is, MS-HuBERT, anend-to-end self-supervised pre-training method for learning robust speechrepresentations. It beats vanilla HuBERT on the ASR Librispeech benchmark onaverage by a 5% margin when evaluated on different finetuning splits.Additionally, we demonstrate that the learned embeddings obtained duringpre-training encode essential information for improving performance of contentbased tasks such as ASR."

                "abstract": "Although Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved human-like performance for a few languages, the majority of the world's languages do not have usable systems due to the lack of large speech datasets to train these models. Cross-lingual transfer is an attractive solution to this problem, because low-resource languages can potentially benefit from higher-resource languages either through transfer learning, or being jointly trained in the same multilingual model. The problem of cross-lingual transfer has been well studied in ASR, however, recent advances in Self Supervised Learning are opening up avenues for unlabeled speech data to be used in multilingual ASR models, which can pave the way for improved performance on low-resource languages. In this paper, we survey the state of the art in multilingual ASR models that are built with cross-lingual transfer in mind. We present best practices for building multilingual models from research across diverse languages and techniques, discuss open questions and provide recommendations for future work."

With multilingualism becoming common in today's world, there has been increasing interest in code-switching ASR as well. In code-switching, multiple languages are freely interchanged within a single sentence or between sentences. The success of low-resource multilingual and code-switching ASR often depends on the variety of languages in terms of their acoustics, linguistic characteristics as well as the amount of data available and how these are carefully considered in building the ASR system. In this challenge, we would like to focus on building multilingual and code-switching ASR systems through two different subtasks related to a total of seven Indian languages, namely Hindi, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati and Bengali. For this purpose, we provide a total of ~600 hours of transcribed speech data, comprising train and test sets, in these languages including two code-switched language pairs, Hindi-English and Bengali-English. We also provide a baseline recipe for both the tasks with a WER of 30.73% and 32.45% on the test sets of multilingual and code-switching subtasks, respectively."

                "abstract": "Deep Contextual Language Models (LMs) like ELMO, BERT, and their successors dominate the landscape of Natural Language Processing due to their ability to scale across multiple tasks rapidly by pre-training a single model, followed by task-specific fine-tuning. Furthermore, multilingual versions of such models like XLM-R and mBERT have given promising results in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, potentially enabling NLP applications in many under-served and under-resourced languages. Due to this initial success, pre-trained models are being used as `Universal Language Models' as the starting point across diverse tasks, domains, and languages. This work explores the notion of `Universality' by identifying seven dimensions across which a universal model should be able to scale, that is, perform equally well or reasonably well, to be useful across diverse settings. We outline the current theoretical and empirical results that support model performance across these dimensions, along with extensions that may help address some of their current limitations. Through this survey, we lay the foundation for understanding the capabilities and limitations of massive contextual language models and help discern research gaps and directions for future work to make these LMs inclusive and fair to diverse applications, users, and linguistic phenomena."

The languages that these models are evaluated on, however, are very few in number, and it is unlikely that evaluation datasets will cover all the languages that these models support. Potential solutions to the costly problem of dataset creation are to translate datasets to new languages or use template-filling based techniques for creation. This paper proposes an alternate solution for evaluating a model across languages which make use of the existing performance scores of the model on languages that a particular task has test sets for. We train a predictor on these performance scores and use this predictor to predict the model's performance in different evaluation settings. Our results show that our method is effective in filling the gaps in the evaluation for an existing set of languages, but might require additional improvements if we want it to generalize to unseen languages."

Specifically, our evaluation benchmark includes Language Identification from text, POS tagging, Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, Question Answering and a new task for code-switching, Natural Language Inference. We present results on all these tasks using cross-lingual word embedding models and multilingual models. In addition, we fine-tune multilingual models on artificially generated code-switched data. Although multilingual models perform significantly better than cross-lingual models, our results show that in most tasks, across both language pairs, multilingual models fine-tuned on code-switched data perform best, showing that multilingual models can be further optimized for code-switching tasks."

Code-switched speech co-occurs with monolingual speech in one or both languages being mixed. In this work, we show that fine-tuning ASR models on code-switched speech harms performance on monolingual speech. We point out the need to optimize models for code-switching while also ensuring that monolingual performance is not sacrificed. Monolingual models may be trained on thousands of hours of speech which may not be available for re-training a new model. We propose using the Learning Without Forgetting (LWF) framework for code-switched ASR when we only have access to a monolingual model and do not have the data it was trained on. We show that it is possible to train models using this framework that perform well on both code-switched and monolingual test sets. In cases where we have access to monolingual training data as well, we propose regularization strategies for fine-tuning models for code-switching without sacrificing monolingual accuracy. We report improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) in monolingual and code-switched test sets compared to baselines that use pooled data and simple fine-tuning."

Our experiments indicated that this loss in performance could be mitigated by using certain strategies for fine-tuning and regularization, leading to improvements in both monolingual and code-switched ASR. In this work, we present further improvements over our previous work by using domain adversarial learning to train task agnostic models. We evaluate the classification accuracy of an adversarial discriminator and show that it can learn shared layer parameters that are task agnostic. We train end-to-end ASR systems starting with a pooled model that uses monolingual and code-switched data along with the adversarial discriminator.

Since no publicly available dataset exists for Spoken Term Detection in these languages, we create a new dataset using a publicly available TTS dataset. We report a standard metric for STD, Mean Term Weighted Value (MTWV) and show that ASR systems built in languages that are phonetically similar to the target languages have higher accuracy, however, it is also possible to get high MTWV scores for dissimilar languages by using a relaxed phone matching algorithm. We propose a technique to bootstrap the Grapheme-to-Phoneme (g2p) mapping between all the languages under consideration using publicly available resources. Gains are obtained when we combine the output of multiple ASR systems and when we use language-specific Language Models. We show that it is possible to perform STD cross-lingually in a zero-shot manner without the need for any language-specific speech data.

In particular, this implies that this tiling problem is aperiodic, in the sense that (in the standard universe of ZFC) there exist translational tilings of E by the tiles F1,F2, but no periodic tilings. Previously, such aperiodic or undecidable translational tilings were only constructed for sets of eleven or more tiles (mostly in Z2). A similar construction also applies for G=Zd for sufficiently large d. If one allows the group G0 to be non-abelian, a variant of the construction produces an undecidable translational tiling with only one tile F. The argument proceeds by first observing that a single tiling equation is able to encode an arbitrary system of tiling equations, which in turn can encode an arbitrary system of certain functional equations once one has two or more tiles. In particular, one can use two tiles to encode tiling problems for an arbitrary number of tiles.              Keywords:                    Aperiodic tiling; Decidability; Translational tiling."

The human genome encodes a far greater number of Ser/Thr protein kinases than of phosphatases. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), in particular, is ubiquitously distributed and regulates a broad range of cellular functions, including glycogen metabolism, cell-cycle progression and muscle relaxation. PP1 has evolved effective catalytic machinery but lacks substrate specificity. Substrate specificity is conferred upon PP1 through interactions with a large number of regulatory subunits. The regulatory subunits are generally unrelated, but most possess the RVxF motif, a canonical PP1-binding sequence. Here we reveal the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the complex between PP1 and a 34-kDa N-terminal domain of the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit MYPT1. MYPT1 is the protein that regulates PP1 function in smooth muscle relaxation. Structural elements amino- and carboxy-terminal to the RVxF motif of MYPT1 are positioned in a way that leads to a pronounced reshaping of the catalytic cleft of PP1, contributing to the increased myosin specificity of this complex. The structure has general implications for the control of PP1 activity by other regulatory subunits."

(1999) Biochemistry 38, 6678-6688]. Here we report that the Ca2+-absent inhibitory activity of troponin (Tn) was progressively lost as the extent of photo-cross-linking increased. To extend these studies, we constructed a mutant TnI with a single cysteine at residue 121 (TnI121). In Tn complexes containing TnI121 and mutant TnCs with a single cysteine at positions 12, 48, 82, 98, or 125 (TnC12, TnC48 etc.), TnI121 formed disulfide cross-links primarily with TnC48 and TnC82 when Ca2+ was present, and with only TnC48 when Ca2+ was absent. These results indicate that TnI Met121 is situated within the N-domain hydrophobic cleft of TnC in the presence of Ca2+, and that it moves out of the cleft upon Ca2+ removal but remains within the vicinity of TnC. Activity assays revealed that the Met121 to Cys mutation in TnI121 reduced the Ca2+-present activation of Tn, indicating that Met121 is important in hydrophobic interactions between this TnI region and TnC's N-domain cleft. The formation of a disulfide cross-link between TnI121 and TnC48 or TnC82 abolished the Ca2+-absent inhibitory activity of Tn, indicating that the movement of the Met121 region of TnI out of TnC's N-domain cleft is essential for the occurrence of further events in the inhibitory process of skeletal muscle contraction. On the basis of these and other results, a simple mechanism for Ca2+ regulation of skeletal muscle contraction is presented and discussed."

In the absence of Ca(2+), contraction is inhibited, whereas myosin-actin interaction and contraction can take place in its presence. Although it is well established that the interaction of troponin-I (TnI), the inhibitory subunit of Tn, with actin is required for the inhibition process and that there are two separate actin-binding regions in TnI that interact with actin, the molecular mechanism of this inhibition process is still not clear. Using TnI mutants with photocrosslinking probes attached to genetically engineered cysteine residues in each of the two actin-binding regions, we show that both regions are close to Met47 of actin in its outer domain. It has been proposed that the Ca(2+)-induced activation of contraction involves the movement of Tm from the outer to the inner domain of the actin filament. On the basis of our results presented here, we propose that the position of Tm at the outer domain of actin in the Ca(2+)-free state is stabilized by the presence of TnI over actin's outer domain via mutual interactions of all three components. In the presence of Ca(2+), TnI's actin-binding regions dissociate from actin allowing Tm to move toward actin's inner domain."

                "abstract": "The coordinated and reciprocal action of serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinases and phosphatases produces transient phosphorylation, a fundamental regulatory mechanism for many biological processes. The human genome encodes a far greater number of Ser/Thr protein kinases than of phosphatases. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), in particular, is ubiquitously distributed and regulates a broad range of cellular functions, including glycogen metabolism, cell-cycle progression and muscle relaxation1,2. PP1 has evolved effective catalytic machinery but lacks substrate specificity. Substrate specificity is conferred upon PP1 through interactions with a large number of regulatory subunits. The regulatory subunits are generally unrelated, but most possess the RVxF motif, a canonical PP1-binding sequence. Here we reveal the crystal structure at 2.7 Å resolution of the complex between PP1 and a 34-kDa N-terminal domain of the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit MYPT1. MYPT1 is the protein that regulates PP1 function in smooth muscle relaxation3. Structural elements amino- and carboxy-terminal to the RVxF motif of MYPT1 are positioned in a way that leads to a pronounced reshaping of the catalytic cleft of PP1, contributing to the increased myosin specificity of this complex. The structure has general implications for the control of PP1 activity by other regulatory subunits."

                "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the problem of recovering an unknown matrix from a small fraction of its entries. This is known as the matrix completion problem, and comes up in a great number of applications, including the famous Netflix Prize and other similar questions in collaborative filtering. In general, accurate recovery of a matrix from a small number of entries is impossible; but the knowledge that the unknown matrix has low rank radically changes this premise, making the search for solutions meaningful.This paper presents optimality results quantifying the minimum number of entries needed to recover a matrix of rank r exactly by any method whatsoever (the information theoretic limit). More importantly, the paper shows that, under certain incoherence assumptions on the singular vectors of the matrix, recovery is possible by solving a convenient convex program as soon as the number of entries is on the order of the information theoretic limit (up to logarithmic factors). This convex program simply finds, among all matrices consistent with the observed entries, that with minimum nuclear norm. As an example, we show that on the order of nr log(n) samples are needed to recover a random n x n matrix of rank r by any method, and to be sure, nuclear norm minimization succeeds as soon as the number of entries is of the form nr polylog(n).

                "abstract": "This paper considers the classical error correcting problem which is frequently discussed in coding theory. We wish to recover an input vector $f \\in \\R^n$ from corrupted measurements $y = A f + e$. Here, $A$ is an $m$ by $n$ (coding) matrix and $e$ is an arbitrary and unknown vector of errors. Is it possible to recover $f$ exactly from the data $y$? We prove that under suitable conditions on the coding matrix $A$, the input $f$ is the unique solution to the $\\ell_1$-minimization problem ($\\|x\\|_{\\ell_1} := \\sum_i |x_i|$) $$ \\min_{g \\in \\R^n} \\| y - Ag \\|_{\\ell_1} $$ provided that the support of the vector of errors is not too large, $\\|e\\|_{\\ell_0} := |\\{i : e_i \\neq 0\\}| \\le \\rho \\cdot m$ for some $\\rho  0$. In short, $f$ can be recovered exactly by solving a simple convex optimization problem (which one can recast as a linear program). In addition, numerical experiments suggest that this recovery procedure works unreasonably well; $f$ is recovered exactly even in situations where a significant fraction of the output is corrupted."

We performa thorough empirical study to measure effects of these factors using a novelquestion and answer dataset from the website Reddit.com. To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first such analysis of its kind on this important topic.We also use a sparse nonnegative matrix factorization technique toautomatically induce interpretable semantic factors from the question dataset.We also document various patterns on response prediction we observe during ouranalysis in the data. For instance, we found that preference-probing questionsare scantily answered. Our method is robust to capture such latent responsefactors.

KGEval binds facts of a KG usingcoupling constraints and crowdsources the facts that infer correctness of largeparts of the KG. We demonstrate that the objective optimized by KGEval issubmodular and NP-hard, allowing guarantees for our approximation algorithm.Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate thatKGEval is able to estimate KG accuracy more accurately compared to othercompetitive baselines, while requiring significantly lesser number of humanevaluations."

Most of the previous work inthis area have focused only on binary RSI, i.e., inducing only the subject andobject type signatures per relation. However, in practice, many relations arehigh-order, i.e., they have more than two arguments and inducing typesignatures of all arguments is necessary. For example, in the sports domain,inducing a schema win(WinningPlayer, OpponentPlayer, Tournament, Location) ismore informative than inducing just win(WinningPlayer, OpponentPlayer). Werefer to this problem as Higher-order Relation Schema Induction (HRSI). In thispaper, we propose Tensor Factorization with Back-off and Aggregation (TFBA), anovel framework for the HRSI problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is thefirst attempt at inducing higher-order relation schemata from unlabeled text.Using the experimental analysis on three real world datasets, we show how TFBAhelps in dealing with sparsity and induce higher order schemata."

We explore the use of inter-instance couplings based on verb-phraseand entity type similarities. We propose a novel technique, CANDiS, which castsdistant supervision using inter-instance coupling into an end-to-end neuralnetwork model. CANDiS incorporates an attention module at the instance-level tomodel the multi-instance nature of this problem.

While many existing methods dopoorly at learning from a handful of examples, large pretrained language modelshave recently been shown to be efficient few-shot learners. One approach tofew-shot learning, which does not require finetuning of model parameters, is toaugment the language model's input with priming text which is typicallyconstructed using task specific descriptions and examples. In this work, wefurther explore priming-based few-shot learning, with focus on using examplesas prompts. We show that presenting examples in the right order is key forgeneralization. We introduce PERO (Prompting with Examples in the Right Order),where we formulate few-shot learning as search over the set of permutations ofthe training examples. We show that PERO can learn to generalize efficientlyusing as few as 10 examples, in contrast to existing approaches. While thenewline token is a natural choice for separating the examples in the prompt, weshow that learning a new separator token can potentially provide further gainsin performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on thetasks of sentiment classification, natural language inference and factretrieval. Finally, we analyze the learned prompts to reveal novel insights,including the idea that two training examples in the right order alone canprovide competitive performance for sentiment classification and naturallanguage inference."

Such generated naturallanguage (NL) explanations are expected to be faithful, i.e., they shouldcorrelate well with the model's internal decision making. In this work, wefocus on the task of natural language inference (NLI) and address the followingquestion: can we build NLI systems which produce labels with high accuracy,while also generating faithful explanations of its decisions? We proposeNatural-language Inference over Label-specific Explanations (NILE), a novel NLImethod which utilizes auto-generated label-specific NL explanations to producelabels along with its faithful explanation. We demonstrate NILE's effectivenessover previously reported methods through automated and human evaluation of theproduced labels and explanations. Our evaluation of NILE also supports theclaim that accurate systems capable of providing testable explanations of theirdecisions can be designed. We discuss the faithfulness of NILE's explanationsin terms of sensitivity of the decisions to the corresponding explanations. Weargue that explicit evaluation of faithfulness, in addition to label andexplanation accuracy, is an important step in evaluating model's explanations.Further, we demonstrate that task-specific probes are necessary to establishsuch sensitivity."

Recent research has posed canonicalization of Open KBs asclustering over manuallydefined feature spaces. Manual feature engineering isexpensive and often sub-optimal. In order to overcome this challenge, wepropose Canonicalization using Embeddings and Side Information (CESI) - a novelapproach which performs canonicalization over learned embeddings of Open KBs.CESI extends recent advances in KB embedding by incorporating relevant NP andrelation phrase side information in a principled manner.

Yet, without ground-truth validation, different tractography algorithms can yield widely varying connectivity estimates. Although streamline pruning techniques mitigate this challenge, slow compute times preclude their use in big-data applications. We present 'Regularized, Accelerated, Linear Fascicle Evaluation' (ReAl-LiFE), a GPU-based implementation of a state-of-the-art streamline pruning algorithm (LiFE), which achieves >100× speedups over previous CPU-based implementations. Leveraging these speedups, we overcome key limitations with LiFE's algorithm to generate sparser and more accurate connectomes. We showcase ReAl-LiFE's ability to estimate connections with superlative test-retest reliability, while outperforming competing approaches. Moreover, we predicted inter-individual variations in multiple cognitive scores with ReAl-LiFE connectome features. We propose ReAl-LiFE as a timely tool, surpassing the state of the art, for accurate discovery of individualized brain connectomes at scale. Finally, our GPU-accelerated implementation of a popular non-negative least-squares optimization algorithm is widely applicable to many real-world problems."

Improving grain Fe in rice, therefore, could have a positive impact for humans worldwide, especially for those people who consume rice as a staple food. In this study, 225-269 accessions of the Bengal and Assam Aus Panel (BAAP) were investigated for their accumulation of grain Fe in two consecutive years in a field experiment under alternative wetting and drying (AWD) and continuous flooded (CF) irrigation. AWD reduced straw Fe by 40% and grain Fe by 5.5-13%. Genotype differences accounted for 35% of the variation in grain Fe, while genotype by irrigation interaction accounted for 12% of the variation in straw and grain Fe in year 1, with no significant interactions detected in year 2. Twelve rice accessions were identified as having high grain Fe for both years regardless of irrigation treatment, half of which were from BAAP aus subgroup 3 which prominently comes from Bangladesh. On average, subgroup 3 had higher grain Fe than the other four subgroups of aus. Genome-wide association mapping identified 6 genomic loci controlling natural variation of grain Fe concentration in plants grown under AWD. For one QTL, nicotianamine synthase OsNAS3 is proposed as candidate for controlling natural variation of grain Fe in rice. The BAAP contains three haplotypes of OsNAS3 where one haplotype (detected in 31% of the individuals) increased grain Fe up to 11%. Haplotype analysis of this gene in rice suggests that the ability to detect the QTL is enhanced in the BAAP because the high Fe allele is balanced in aus, unlike indica and japonica subgroups.

Current demand far exceeds available resource, and therefore it is integral that healthcare resource is fairly rationed to those who need it most. We therefore set out to determine if pre-operative health-related quality of life assessment (HRQoL) could be used to triage arthroplasty waiting lists.              Methods:                    Data regarding demographics, perioperative variables and patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) (pre-operative and 1-year post-operative EuroQOL five dimension (EQ-5D-3L) and Oxford hip and knee scores (OHS/OKS) were retrospectively extracted from electronic patient health records at a large university teaching hospital. Patients were split into two equal groups based on pre-operative EQ-5D TTO scores and compared (Group1 [worse HRQoL] = -0.239 to 0.487; Group2 [better HRQoL] = 0.516-1 [best]).              Results:                    513 patients were included. Patients in Group1 had significantly greater improvement in post-operative EQ-5D-3L scores compared to Group2 (Median 0.67 vs. 0.19; p < 0.0001), as well as greater improvement in OHS/OKS (Mean 22.4 vs. 16.4; p < 0.0001). Those in Group2 were significantly less likely to achieve the EQ-5D-3L minimum clinically important difference (MCID) attainment (OR 0.13, 95%CI 0.07-0.23; p < 0.0001) with a trend towards lower OHS/OKS MCID attainment (OR 0.66, 95%CI 0.37-1.19; p = 0.168). There was no clinically significant difference in length of stay (Median 3-days both groups), and no statistically significant difference in adverse events (30 days and 1 year readmission/reoperation).              Conclusions:                    A pre-operative EQ-5D-3L cut-off of ≤0.487 for hip and knee arthroplasty prioritisation may help to maximise clinical utility and cost-effectiveness in a limited resource setting post COVID-19.

This approach is the first to simultaneously track diverse reading subprocesses during complex story processing and predict the detailed neural representation of diverse story features, ranging from visual word properties to the mention of different story characters and different actions they perform. We construct brain representation maps that replicate many results from a wide range of classical studies that focus each on one aspect of language processing and offer new insights on which type of information is processed by different areas involved in language processing.

Natural host resistance is an attractive control strategy because the speed of the parasite's life cycle and the broad host range it attacks make other control measures challenging. Although resistance has been found in the domesticated African rice Oryza glaberrima and the wild rice species O. longistaminata, the introgression of resistance genes to Asian rice O. sativa is challenging. Resistance due to a major gene in O. sativa would greatly aid breeding. Recently two accessions resistant to M. graminicola have been identified in a screen of 332 diverse O. sativa cultivars. In this study, these two resistant cultivars, LD 24 (an indica from Sri Lanka) and Khao Pahk Maw (an aus from Thailand), were crossed with a moderately susceptible cultivar, Vialone Nano (a temperate japonica from Italy). Approximately 175 F2 progeny of both populations were screened for susceptibility to M. graminicola infection. Between 20 and 23 individuals with highest and lowest galls per plants were pooled to make susceptible and resistant bulks which were sequenced to conduct bulked segregant analysis using the QTL-seq method. This revealed a nematode resistance locus from 23 Mbp to the bottom of rice chromosome 11 in both crosses suggesting a rare introgression of the same locus is responsible for resistance in both cultivars. While this information can be used in marker-assisted breeding, analysis of available SNP data revealed candidate loci and genes worthy of further investigation for gene identification.

Furthermore, how does this connectivity differ across different human subjects? In this work, we show that this problem, even though originating from the field of neuroscience, can benefit from big data techniques; we present a simple, novel good-enough brain model, or GeBM in short, and a novel algorithm Sparse-SysId, which are able to effectively model the dynamics of the neuron interactions and infer the functional connectivity. Moreover, GeBM is able to simulate basic psychological phenomena such as habituation and priming (whose definition we provide in the main text). We evaluate GeBM by using real brain data. GeBM produces brain activity patterns that are strikingly similar to the real ones, where the inferred functional connectivity is able to provide neuroscientific insights toward a better understanding of the way that neurons interact with each other, as well as detect regularities and outliers in multisubject brain activity measurements."

However, it has been demonstrated that inorganic arsenic is taken up by rice through silicon transporters under anaerobic conditions, thus the ability to efficiently take up silicon may be considered either a positive or a negative trait in rice. Germanium is an analogue of silicon that produces brown lesions in shoots and leaves, and germanium toxicity has been used to identify mutants in silicon and arsenic transport. In this study, two different genetic mapping methods were performed to determine the loci involved in germanium sensitivity in rice. Genetic mapping in the biparental cross of Bala × Azucena (an F6 population) and a genome wide association (GWA) study with 350 accessions from the Rice Diversity Panel 1 were conducted using 15 μM of germanic acid. This identified a number of germanium sensitive loci: some co-localised with previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for tissue silicon or arsenic concentration, none co-localised with Lsi1 or Lsi6, while one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected within 200 kb of Lsi2 (these are genes known to transport silicon, whose identity was discovered using germanium toxicity). However, examining candidate genes that are within the genomic region of the loci detected above reveals genes homologous to both Lsi1 and Lsi2, as well as a number of other candidate genes, which are discussed."

The resulting model takes advantage of the complementary strengths and weaknesses of corpus and brain activation data to give a more complete representation of semantics. Evaluations show that the model 1) matches a behavioral measure of semantics more closely, 2) can be used to predict corpus data for unseen words and 3) has predictive power that generalizes across brain imaging technologies and across subjects.

Yet, without ground-truth validation, different tractography algorithms can yield widely varying connectivity estimates. Although streamline pruning techniques mitigate this challenge, slow compute times preclude their use in big-data applications. We present ‘Regularized, Accelerated, Linear Fascicle Evaluation’ (ReAl-LiFE), a GPU-based implementation of a state-of-the-art streamline pruning algorithm (LiFE), which achieves >100× speedups over previous CPU-based implementations. Leveraging these speedups, we overcome key limitations with LiFE’s algorithm to generate sparser and more accurate connectomes. We showcase ReAl-LiFE’s ability to estimate connections with superlative test–retest reliability, while outperforming competing approaches. Moreover, we predicted inter-individual variations in multiple cognitive scores with ReAl-LiFE connectome features. We propose ReAl-LiFE as a timely tool, surpassing the state of the art, for accurate discovery of individualized brain connectomes at scale. Finally, our GPU-accelerated implementation of a popular non-negative least-squares optimization algorithm is widely applicable to many real-world problems."

                "abstract": "India is a multilingual society with 1369 rationalized languages and dialects being spoken across the country (INDIA, 2011). Of these, the 22 scheduled languages have a staggering total of 1.17 billion speakers and 121 languages have more than 10,000 speakers (INDIA, 2011). India also has the second largest (and an ever growing) digital footprint (Statista, 2020). Despite this, today's state-of-the-art multilingual systems perform suboptimally on Indian (IN) languages. This can be explained by the fact that multilingual language models (LMs) are often trained on 100+ languages together, leading to a small representation of IN languages in their vocabulary and training data. Multilingual LMs are substantially less effective in resource-lean scenarios (Wu and Dredze, 2020; Lauscher et al., 2020), as limited data doesn't help capture the various nuances of a language. One also commonly observes IN language text transliterated to Latin or code-mixed with English, especially in informal settings (for example, on social media platforms) (Rijhwani et al., 2017). This phenomenon is not adequately handled by current state-of-the-art multilingual LMs. To address the aforementioned gaps, we propose MuRIL, a multilingual LM specifically built for IN languages. MuRIL is trained on significantly large amounts of IN text corpora only. We explicitly augment monolingual text corpora with both translated and transliterated document pairs, that serve as supervised cross-lingual signals in training. MuRIL significantly outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on all tasks in the challenging cross-lingual XTREME benchmark (Hu et al., 2020). We also present results on transliterated (native to Latin script) test sets of the chosen datasets and demonstrate the efficacy of MuRIL in handling transliterated data."

While Question Answering over KG (KGQA) has received some attention from the research community, QA over Temporal KGs (Temporal KGQA) is a relatively unexplored area. Lack of broad coverage datasets has been another factor limiting progress in this area. We address this challenge by presenting CRONQUESTIONS, the largest known Temporal KGQA dataset, clearly stratified into buckets of structural complexity. CRONQUESTIONS expands the only known previous dataset by a factor of 340x. We find that various state-of-the-art KGQA methods fall far short of the desired performance on this new dataset. In response, we also propose CRONKGQA, a transformer-based solution that exploits recent advances in Temporal KG embeddings, and achieves performance superior to all baselines, with an increase of 120% in accuracy over the next best performing method. Through extensive experiments, we give detailed insights into the workings of CRONKGQA, as well as situations where significant further improvements appear possible. In addition to the dataset, we have released our code as well."

While many existing methods do poorly at learning from a handful of examples, large pretrained language models have recently been shown to be efficient few-shot learners. One approach to few-shot learning, which does not require finetuning of model parameters, is to augment the language model's input with priming text which is typically constructed using task specific descriptions and examples. In this work, we further explore priming-based few-shot learning, with focus on using examples as prompts. We show that presenting examples in the right order is key for generalization. We introduce PERO (Prompting with Examples in the Right Order), where we formulate few-shot learning as search over the set of permutations of the training examples. We show that PERO can learn to generalize efficiently using as few as 10 examples, in contrast to existing approaches. While the newline token is a natural choice for separating the examples in the prompt, we show that learning a new separator token can potentially provide further gains in performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the tasks of sentiment classification, natural language inference and fact retrieval. Finally, we analyze the learned prompts to reveal novel insights, including the idea that two training examples in the right order alone can provide competitive performance for sentiment classification and natural language inference."

This has prompted the creation of an ever-growing pre-trained model universe, where each model is trained on large amounts of language or domain specific data with a carefully curated, linguistically informed vocabulary. However, doing so brings us back full circle and prevents one from leveraging the benefits of multilinguality. To address the gaps at both ends of the spectrum, we propose MergeDistill, a framework to merge pre-trained LMs in a way that can best leverage their assets with minimal dependencies, using task-agnostic knowledge distillation. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework in a practical setting by leveraging pre-existing teacher LMs and training student LMs that perform competitively with or even outperform teacher LMs trained on several orders of magnitude more data and with a fixed model capacity. We also highlight the importance of teacher selection and its impact on student model performance."

                "abstract": "Recent research in multilingual language models (LM) has demonstrated their ability to effectively handle multiple languages in a single model. This holds promise for low web-resource languages (LRL) as multilingual models can enable transfer of supervision from high resource languages to LRLs. However, incorporating a new language in an LM still remains a challenge, particularly for languages with limited corpora and in unseen scripts. In this paper we argue that relatedness among languages in a language family may be exploited to overcome some of the corpora limitations of LRLs, and propose RelateLM. We focus on Indian languages, and exploit relatedness along two dimensions: (1) script (since many Indic scripts originated from the Brahmic script), and (2) sentence structure. RelateLM uses transliteration to convert the unseen script of limited LRL text into the script of a Related Prominent Language (RPL) (Hindi in our case). While exploiting similar sentence structures, RelateLM utilizes readily available bilingual dictionaries to pseudo translate RPL text into LRL corpora. Experiments on multiple real-world benchmark datasets provide validation to our hypothesis that using a related language as pivot, along with transliteration and pseudo translation based data augmentation, can be an effective way to adapt LMs for LRLs, rather than direct training or pivoting through English."

Therefore, the task of predicting new facts, i.e., link prediction, becomes an important step while using these graphs in downstream tasks such as text comprehension, question answering, and web search query recommendation. Learning embeddings for OpenKGs is one approach for link prediction that has received some attention lately. However, on careful examination, we found that current OpenKG link prediction algorithms often predict noun phrases (NPs) with incompatible types for given noun and relation phrases. We address this problem in this work and propose OKGIT that improves OpenKG link prediction using novel type compatibility score and type regularization.

Although facts themselves are language-agnostic, the fact labels (i.e., language-specific representation of the fact) in the KG are often present only in a few languages. This makes it challenging to link KG facts to sentences in languages other than the limited set of languages. To address this problem, we introduce the task of Multilingual Fact Linking (MFL) where the goal is to link fact expressed in a sentence to corresponding fact in the KG, even when the fact label in the KG is not available in the language of the sentence. To facilitate research in this area, we present a new evaluation dataset, IndicLink. This dataset contains 11,293 linked WikiData facts and 6,429 sentences spanning English and six Indian languages. We propose a Retrieval+Generation model, ReFCoG, that can scale to millions of KG facts by combining Dual Encoder based retrieval with a Seq2Seq based generation model which is constrained to output only valid KG facts. ReFCoG outperforms standard Retrieval+Re-ranking models by 10.7 pts in Precision@1. In spite of this gain, the model achieves an overall score of 52.1, showing ample scope for improvement in the task.ReFCoG code and IndicLink data are available at this https URL"

Going beyond such simple constraints, recent works have started exploring the incorporation of complex syntactic-guidance as constraints in the task of controlled paraphrase generation. In these methods, syntactic-guidance is sourced from a separate exemplar sentence. However, these prior works have only utilized limited syntactic information available in the parse tree of the exemplar sentence. We address this limitation in the paper and propose Syntax Guided Controlled Paraphraser (SGCP), an end-to-end framework for syntactic paraphrase generation. We find that SGCP can generate syntax conforming sentences while not compromising on relevance. We perform extensive automated and human evaluations over multiple real-world English language datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of SGCP over state-of-the-art baselines.

While it is desirable to use the same method to represent documents as well, unfortunately, the effectiveness is lost when representing long documents involving multiple sentences. One of the key reasons is that a longer document is likely to contain words from many different topics; hence, creating a single vector while ignoring all the topical structure is unlikely to yield an effective document representation. This problem is less acute in single sentences and other short text fragments where the presence of a single topic is most likely. To alleviate this problem, we present P-SIF, a partitioned word averaging model to represent long documents. P-SIF retains the simplicity of simple weighted word averaging while taking a document's topical structure into account. In particular, P-SIF learns topic-specific vectors from a document and finally concatenates them all to represent the overall document. We provide theoretical justifications on the correctness of P-SIF. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we demonstrate P-SIF's effectiveness compared to simple weighted averaging and many other baselines."

Such generated natural language (NL) explanations are expected to be faithful, i.e., they should correlate well with the model's internal decision making. In this work, we focus on the task of natural language inference (NLI) and address the following question: can we build NLI systems which produce labels with high accuracy, while also generating faithful explanations of its decisions? We propose Natural-language Inference over Label-specific Explanations (NILE), a novel NLI method which utilizes auto-generated label-specific NL explanations to produce labels along with its faithful explanation. We demonstrate NILE's effectiveness over previously reported methods through automated and human evaluation of the produced labels and explanations. Our evaluation of NILE also supports the claim that accurate systems capable of providing testable explanations of their decisions can be designed. We discuss the faithfulness of NILE's explanations in terms of sensitivity of the decisions to the corresponding explanations. We argue that explicit evaluation of faithfulness, in addition to label and explanation accuracy, is an important step in evaluating model's explanations. Further, we demonstrate that task-specific probes are necessary to establish such sensitivity."

Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods aim to address this problem by labeling a small subset of the nodes as seeds and then utilizing the graph structure to predict label scores for the rest of the nodes in the graph. Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved impressive performance on the graph-based SSL task. In addition to label scores, it is also desirable to have confidence scores associated with them. Unfortunately, confidence estimation in the context of GCN has not been previously explored. We fill this important gap in this paper and propose ConfGCN, which estimates labels scores along with their confidences jointly in GCN-based setting. ConfGCN uses these estimated confidences to determine the influence of one node on another during neighborhood aggregation, thereby acquiring anisotropic capabilities. Through extensive analysis and experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that ConfGCN is able to outperform state-of-the-art baselines.

We investigate these questions using sentences with simple syntax and semantics (e.g., The bone was eaten by the dog.). We consider multiple neural network architectures, including recently proposed ELMo and BERT. We use magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain recording data collected from human subjects when they were reading these simple sentences.Overall, we find that BERT's activations correlate the best with MEG brain data. We also find that the deep network representation can be used to generate brain data from new sentences to augment existing brain data.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work showing that the MEG brain recording when reading a word in a sentence can be used to distinguish earlier words in the sentence. Our exploration is also the first to use deep neural network representations to generate synthetic brain data and to show that it helps in improving subsequent stimuli decoding task accuracy.

One popular way to accomplish this is to generate low-dimensional embeddings of entities and relations, and use these to make inferences. ConvE, a recently proposed approach, applies convolutional filters on 2D reshapings of entity and relation embeddings in order to capture rich interactions between their components. However, the number of interactions that ConvE can capture is limited. In this paper, we analyze how increasing the number of these interactions affects link prediction performance, and utilize our observations to propose InteractE. InteractE is based on three key ideas -- feature permutation, a novel feature reshaping, and circular convolution. Through extensive experiments, we find that InteractE outperforms state-of-the-art convolutional link prediction baselines on FB15k-237. Further, InteractE achieves an MRR score that is 9%, 7.5%, and 23% better than ConvE on the FB15k-237, WN18RR and YAGO3-10 datasets respectively. The results validate our central hypothesis -- that increasing feature interaction is beneficial to link prediction performance. We make the source code of InteractE available to encourage reproducible research."

Most of the existing approaches to handle such graphs suffer from over-parameterization and are restricted to learning representations of nodes only. In this paper, we propose CompGCN, a novel Graph Convolutional framework which jointly embeds both nodes and relations in a relational graph. CompGCN leverages a variety of entity-relation composition operations from Knowledge Graph Embedding techniques and scales with the number of relations. It also generalizes several of the existing multi-relational GCN methods. We evaluate our proposed method on multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, and achieve demonstrably superior results.

There has been some recent progress in defining the notion of pooling in graphs whereby the model tries to generate a graph level representation by downsampling and summarizing the information present in the nodes. Existing pooling methods either fail to effectively capture the graph substructure or do not easily scale to large graphs. In this work, we propose ASAP (Adaptive Structure Aware Pooling), a sparse and differentiable pooling method that addresses the limitations of previous graph pooling architectures. ASAP utilizes a novel self-attention network along with a modified GNN formulation to capture the importance of each node in a given graph. It also learns a sparse soft cluster assignment for nodes at each layer to effectively pool the subgraphs to form the pooled graph. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and theoretical analysis, we motivate our choice of the components used in ASAP. Our experimental results show that combining existing GNN architectures with ASAP leads to state-of-the-art results on multiple graph classification benchmarks. ASAP has an average improvement of 4%, compared to current sparse hierarchical state-of-the-art method."

However, in many real world applications the data is dynamic, i.e., new data arrives at different time intervals. As a result, the tensors used to represent the data grow in size. Besides the tensors, in many real world scenarios, side information is also available in the form of matrices which also grow in size with time. The problem of predicting missing values in the dynamically growing tensor is called dynamic tensor completion. Most of the previous work in dynamic tensor completion make an assumption that the tensor grows only in one mode. To the best of our Knowledge, there is no previous work which incorporates side information with dynamic tensor completion. We bridge this gap in this paper by proposing a dynamic tensor completion framework called Side Information infused Incremental Tensor Analysis (SIITA), which incorporates side information and works for general incremental tensors. We also show how non-negative constraints can be incorporated with SIITA, which is essential for mining interpretable latent clusters. We carry out extensive experiments on multiple real world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of SIITA in various different settings."

Our contributions in this paper are threefold. Firstly, we propose two novel word attention models for distantly- supervised relation extraction: (1) a Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) based word attention model (BGWA), (2) an entity-centric attention model (EA), and (3) a combination model which combines multiple complementary models using weighted voting method for improved relation extraction. Secondly, we introduce GDS, a new distant supervision dataset for relation extraction. GDS removes test data noise present in all previous distant- supervision benchmark datasets, making credible automatic evaluation possible. Thirdly, through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

Some of the major challenges involved in developing such models are, (i) limited availability of materials data as compared to other fields, (ii) lack of universal descriptor of materials to predict its various properties. The limited availability of materials data can be addressed through transfer learning, while the generic representation was recently addressed by Xie and Grossman [1], where they developed a crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) that provides a unified representation of crystals. In this work, we develop a new model (MT-CGCNN) by integrating CGCNN with transfer learning based on multi-task (MT) learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MT-CGCNN by simultaneous prediction of various material properties such as Formation Energy, Band Gap and Fermi Energy for a wide range of inorganic crystals (46774 materials). MT-CGCNN is able to reduce the test error when employed on correlated properties by upto 8%. The model prediction has lower test error compared to CGCNN, even when the training data is reduced by 10%. We also demonstrate our model's better performance through prediction of end user scenario related to metal/non-metal classification. These results encourage further development of machine learning approaches which leverage multi-task learning to address the aforementioned challenges in the discovery of new materials.

Most of the previous work in this area have focused only on binary RSI, i.e., inducing only the subject and object type signatures per relation. However, in practice, many relations are high-order, i.e., they have more than two arguments and inducing type signatures of all arguments is necessary. For example, in the sports domain, inducing a schema win(WinningPlayer, OpponentPlayer, Tournament, Location) is more informative than inducing just win(WinningPlayer, OpponentPlayer). We refer to this problem as Higher-order Relation Schema Induction (HRSI). In this paper, we propose Tensor Factorization with Back-off and Aggregation (TFBA), a novel framework for the HRSI problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at inducing higher-order relation schemata from unlabeled text. Using the experimental analysis on three real world datasets, we show how TFBA helps in dealing with sparsity and induce higher order schemata."

The unsupervised nature of this technique allows it to scale to web-scale relation extraction tasks, at the expense of noise in the training data. Previous work has explored relationships among instances of the same entity-pair to reduce this noise, but relationships among instances across entity-pairs have not been fully exploited. We explore the use of inter-instance couplings based on verb-phrase and entity type similarities. We propose a novel technique, CANDiS, which casts distant supervision using inter-instance coupling into an end-to-end neural network model. CANDiS incorporates an attention module at the instance-level to model the multi-instance nature of this problem. CANDiS outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques on a standard benchmark dataset."

This problem has received significant attention in the past few years and multiple methods have been proposed. Most of the existing methods in the literature use a predefined characteristic scoring function for evaluating the correctness of KG triples. These scoring functions distinguish correct triples (high score) from incorrect ones (low score). However, their performance vary across different datasets. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple neural network based score function can consistently achieve near start-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. We also quantitatively demonstrate biases in standard benchmark datasets, and highlight the need to perform evaluation spanning various datasets."

Automatic identification of relations and their schemas, i.e., type signature of arguments of relations (e.g., undergo(Patient, Surgery)), is an important first step towards this goal. We refer to this problem as Relation Schema Induction (RSI). In this paper, we propose Schema Induction using Coupled Tensor Factorization (SICTF), a novel tensor factorization method for relation schema induction. SICTF factorizes Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) triples extracted from a domain corpus along with additional side information in a principled way to induce relation schemas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of tensor factorization for the RSI problem. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we find that SICTF is not only more accurate than state-of-the-art baselines, but also significantly faster (about 14x faster)."

KGEval binds facts of a KG using coupling constraints and crowdsources the facts that infer correctness of large parts of the KG. We demonstrate that the objective optimized by KGEval is submodular and NP-hard, allowing guarantees for our approximation algorithm. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KGEval is able to estimate KG accuracy more accurately compared to other competitive baselines, while requiring significantly lesser number of human evaluations."

For nodes that the user investigates, we propose to only show the neighbors with the most subjectively interesting neighborhoods. We contribute novel ideas to measure this interestingness in terms of how surprising a neighborhood is given the background distribution, as well as how well it fits the nodes the user chose to explore. We introduce FACETS, a fast and scalable method for visually exploring large graphs. By implementing our above ideas, it allows users to look into the forest through its trees. Empirical evaluation shows that our method works very well in practice, providing rankings of nodes that match interests of users. Moreover, as it scales linearly, FACETS is suited for the exploration of very large graphs."

We perform a thorough empirical study to measure effects of these factors using a novel question and answer dataset from the website this http URL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such analysis of its kind on this important topic. We also use a sparse nonnegative matrix factorization technique to automatically induce interpretable semantic factors from the question dataset. We also document various patterns on response prediction we observe during our analysis in the data. For instance, we found that preference-probing questions are scantily answered. Our method is robust to capture such latent response factors. We hope to make our code and datasets publicly available upon publication of the paper."

In short, we want to find latent variables, that explain both the brain activity, as well as the behavioral responses. We show that this is an instance of the Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization (CMTF) problem. We propose Scoup-SMT, a novel, fast, and parallel algorithm that solves the CMTF problem and produces a sparse latent low-rank subspace of the data. In our experiments, we find that Scoup-SMT is 50-100 times faster than a state-of-the-art algorithm for CMTF, along with a 5 fold increase in sparsity. Moreover, we extend Scoup-SMT to handle missing data without degradation of performance. We apply Scoup-SMT to BrainQ, a dataset consisting of a (nouns, brain voxels, human subjects) tensor and a (nouns, properties) matrix, with coupling along the nouns dimension. Scoup-SMT is able to find meaningful latent variables, as well as to predict brain activity with competitive accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of Scoup-SMT, by applying it on a Facebook dataset (users, friends, wall-postings); there, Scoup-SMT spots spammer-like anomalies."

These methods classify initially unlabeled nodes by propagating label information over the structure of graph starting from seed nodes. Graph-based SSL algorithms usually scale linearly with the number of distinct labels (m), and require O(m) space on each node. Unfortunately, there exist many applications of practical significance with very large m over large graphs, demanding better space and time complexity. In this paper, we propose MAD-SKETCH, a novel graph-based SSL algorithm which compactly stores label distribution on each node using Count-min Sketch, a randomized data structure. We present theoretical analysis showing that under mild conditions, MAD-SKETCH can reduce space complexity at each node from O(m) to O(log m), and achieve similar savings in time complexity as well. We support our analysis through experiments on multiple real world datasets. We observe that MAD-SKETCH achieves similar performance as existing state-of-the-art graph- based SSL algorithms, while requiring smaller memory footprint and at the same time achieving up to 10x speedup. We find that MAD-SKETCH is able to scale to datasets with one million labels, which is beyond the scope of existing graph- based SSL algorithms."

Ideally, one could perform the entire process interactively under one unified interface: defining extractors and wrappers for sources, creating a mediated schema, and adding schema mappings ? while seeing how these impact the integrated view of the data, and refining the design accordingly.We propose a novel smart copy and paste (SCP) model and architecture for seamlessly combining the design-time and run-time aspects of data integration, and we describe an initial prototype, the CopyCat system. In CopyCat, the user does not need special tools for the different stages of integration: instead, the system watches as the user copies data from applications (including the Web browser) and pastes them into CopyCat?s spreadsheet-like workspace. CopyCat generalizes these actions and presents proposed auto-completions, each with an explanation in the form of provenance. The user provides feedback on these suggestions ? through either direct interactions or further copy-and-paste operations ? and the system learns from this feedback. This paper provides an overview of our prototype system, and identifies key research challenges in achieving SCP in its full generality.
