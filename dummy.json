It is critical to identify and classify skin cancer early to assist patients in taking the right course of action. Additionally, melanoma, one of the main skin cancer illnesses, is curable when detected and treated at an early stage. More than 75% of fatalities worldwide are related to skin cancer. A novel Artificial Golden Eagle-based Random Forest (AGEbRF) is created in this study to predict skin cancer cells at an early stage. Dermoscopic images are used in this instance as the dataset for the system's training. Additionally, the dermoscopic image information is processed using the established AGEbRF function to identify and segment the skin cancer-affected area. Additionally, this approach is simulated using a Python program, and the current research's parameters are assessed against those of earlier studies. The results demonstrate that, compared to other models, the new research model produces better accuracy for predicting skin cancer by segmentation.

Therefore, the suggested approach finds the main hole in undersea systems and fills it using robotic automation. In the predicted model, an analytical framework is created to operate the robot within predetermined areas while maximizing communication ranges. Additionally, a clustering algorithm with a fuzzy membership function is implemented, allowing the robots to advance in accordance with predefined clusters and arrive at their starting place within a predetermined amount of time. A cluster node is connected in each clustered region and provides the central control center with the necessary data. The weights are evenly distributed, and the designed robotic system is installed to prevent an uncontrolled operational state. Five different scenarios are used to test and validate the created model, and in each case, the proposed method is found to be superior to the current methodology in terms of range, energy, density, time periods, and total metrics of operation.

These digital biomarkers are created mainly through passive data collection from various sensors. The critical issues with this method are time and sensitivity. We reviewed the newest wireless communication trends employed in hospitals using wearable technology and privacy and Block chain to solve this problem. Based on sensors, this wireless technology controls the data gathered from numerous locations. In this study, the wearable sensor contains data from the various departments of the system. The gradient boosting method and the hybrid microwave transmission method have been proposed to find the location and convince people. The patient health decision has been submitted to hybrid microwave transmission using gradient boosting. This will help to trace the mobile phones using the calls from the threatening person, and the data is gathered from the database while tracing. From this concern, the data analysis process is based on decision-making. They adapted the data encountered by the detailed data in the statistical modeling of the system to produce exploratory data analysis for satisfying the data from the database.
