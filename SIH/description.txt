ScholarSearch is a helpful tool made to simplify how universities and researchers collect and show their research work. In many academic institutions, gathering and analyzing research papers is a slow and difficult process. Usually, people have to check multiple databases like Google Scholar, DBLP, and Scopus to manually gather data about publications. This process takes a lot of time and can lead to mistakes. ScholarSearch changes this by automating the entire task, making it faster and more accurate.

The platform connects with several academic databases, making sure that all research publications are included. This is especially useful for universities when they need to submit reports for accreditation reviews. Whether it's journal articles, conference papers, or other research works, ScholarSearch finds the necessary information based on what the user is looking for. Users can search for publications by year, type, research area, or even based on the author's affiliation. This means universities can customize reports based on what they need, without much effort.

One of the most important features of ScholarSearch is the ability to create author-wise summaries. Instead of manually going through every paper a researcher has written, the platform provides short, clear summaries of their work. This helps users easily understand the contributions of each researcher. The platform also provides key academic metrics like the h-index and i10-index, which show how much impact a researcher has made in their field. Using advanced technology, ScholarSearch makes the process of summarizing work faster and more accurate.

Additionally, ScholarSearch offers a dashboard where users can see detailed analytics of a university's research output. This dashboard shows trends over time, highlights top researchers, and gives insight into collaborations across the institution. Users can filter the data by year, topic, or affiliation, allowing them to dig deeper into the research activity. This helps institutions evaluate their research efforts and make better plans for the future.

Another key feature is the platform's querying and filtering tools. Users can set specific criteria, such as research topics or publication periods, to get customized reports. This is especially useful when universities need to prepare documents for accreditation, as they can easily retrieve publications from a certain time frame or topic. The platform searches multiple databases quickly, ensuring the results are accurate. Users can also export the data in formats like Excel, Word, and Bibtex, making it easy to use the information in other reports.

The user interface of ScholarSearch is designed to be simple and easy to use. Whether people access it through the website, an API, or an Excel extension, the platform can fit into different workflows, giving flexibility in how the data is managed. The interface is straightforward, so even users with little technical experience can use it without any problems.

ScholarSearch also solves common issues like author disambiguation. For instance, it ensures that different versions of the same author's name (e.g., "R. Aluvalu" and "Rajanikanth Aluvalu") are identified as one person by checking the authorâ€™s citations and affiliations from different databases. This makes sure the data is correct and no publications are missed.

In short, ScholarSearch makes it much easier for universities and researchers to manage and show their research work. By connecting with multiple databases, allowing customized searches, creating detailed author summaries, and providing useful analytics, the platform simplifies the entire process of handling research data. Whether preparing for an accreditation review or just keeping track of ongoing research, ScholarSearch saves time, reduces manual work, and gives users the tools they need to make informed decisions.
